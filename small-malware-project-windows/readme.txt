The malware.asm is the main file which deletes all .exe files of the current directory and creates random .exe files infinitely

After assembling usb-recognize.bat it transfers the malware.exe to the usb and runs malware.exe of usb in dosbox

usb-recognize.bat has the paths of masm and dosbox of my personal computer
